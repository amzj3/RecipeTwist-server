Beef in Mushroom Gravy
Ingredients
2 to 2-1/2 pounds boneless beef round steak
1 to 2 envelopes onion soup mix
1 can (10-3/4 ounces) condensed cream of mushroom soup, undiluted
1/2 cup water
Mashed potatoes, optional
Directions
Cut steak into six serving-size pieces; place in a 3-qt. slow cooker. Combine the soup mix, soup and water; pour over beef. Cover and cook on low for 7-8 hours or until meat is tender. If desired, serve with mashed potatoes.
Freeze option: Place beef in freezer containers; top with gravy. Cool and freeze. To use, partially thaw in refrigerator overnight. Heat through in a covered saucepan, gently stirring and adding a little water if necessary.
